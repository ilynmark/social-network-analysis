# Social Network Analysis

This repository contains a notebook, `Social_Network_Analysis.ipynb`, which focuses on analyzing a social network using graph theory and various network analysis techniques. The notebook provides insights and visualizations based on the given connections.txt data. Here is an overview of the notebook's contents:

**Creating a Directed Graph: The notebook starts by creating a directed graph from the provided connections.txt data.

**Identifying Bridge Nodes:** It identifies the nodes that act as bridges within the network.

**Graph Density:** The density of the graph is calculated and discussed in relation to the network's connectivity.

**Node Degree Analysis:** The nodes with the highest and lowest number of connections are identified and presented.

**Incoming and Outgoing Connections:** The nodes with the highest incoming and outgoing connections are determined and displayed.

**Centrality Measures:** The notebook computes and interprets the closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality for each node.

**Community Detection:** A community detection algorithm is applied to identify distinct communities within the directed graph.

**Largest and Smallest Communities:** The largest and smallest communities are identified and analyzed.

**Visualizing Communities:** The three largest communities are visualized separately, and the top three nodes with highest centrality measures are removed and plotted individually.

**Influencers of Top Communities:** The influencers within the top three communities are highlighted and visualized.

**Action Plan:** A hypothetical action plan is designed.

Please refer to the notebook for detailed code implementation, findings, and interpretations.
